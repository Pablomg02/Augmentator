# Augmentator
An Augmented Dataset generator, currently under development for YOLO algorythm data structure.

The main objective of this repository is give a simple way to improve the training of **image oriented Deep Learning Networks**. You only have to get the reository, give to it your folder path and the code do the rest. You can also select the techniques that you wand modify the different parameters, such as the range of modification, the number of images generated or the probability.

For now, you can use the following features:
- **Exposure**
- **Saturation**
- **Hue**
- **X Flip**
- **Y Flip**
- **Blur**
- **Gray scale**

The following features will be available soon:
- **Scaling and cropping**
- **Rotation**
- **Noise**
- *And many more!* Other features are being explored, such as the use of **Generative Adversarial Networks** to create new images.

The repository is in a very early stage, so many changes and features will arrive in a very short time!
